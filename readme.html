This is the readme for the models associated with the paper:

Ferrante M, Ascoli GA (2015) Distinct and synergistic feedforward
inhibition of pyramidal cells by basket and bistratified
interneurons. Front Cell Neurosci 9:439

This NEURON code was contributed by M Ferrante.

Either auto-launch the model from ModelDB or download and compile the
mod files (nrnivmodl (linux/unix), or mknrndll (windows or mac)), and
then start mosinit.hoc (double clicking in file explorer, or drag and
dropping on nrngui (mac), or typing "nrngui mosinit.hoc" on the
command line (without the quotes) on unix/linux.

The short run of the model uses the file
Fig3F_OrangeCurveSubSampled.hoc, takes about a minute to run and as
the title suggests generates the orange curve in Figure 3F in the
paper.  You should see a graph like this:

The long run of the model uses the run_me.hoc file takes about 2 hours
and 10 minutes to complete on a 2012 MacBook Pro.

demo run.
