This is the readme for the models associated with the paper:

Ferrante M, Ascoli GA (2015) Distinct and synergistic feedforward
inhibition of pyramidal cells by basket and bistratified
interneurons. Front Cell Neurosci 9:439

This NEURON code was contributed by M Ferrante.

Either auto-launch the model from ModelDB or download and compile the
mod files (nrnivmodl (linux/unix), or mknrndll (windows or mac)), and
then start run_me.hoc (double clicking in file explorer, or drag and
dropping on nrngui (mac), or typing "nrngui run_me.hoc" on the command
line (without the quotes) on unix/linux.  The default run of the model
auto-launch or supplied by the run_me.hoc file takes about 2 hours and
10 minutes to complete on a 2012 MacBook Pro.
